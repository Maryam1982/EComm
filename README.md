This is my first full stack project (guided) using Node.js and a simple flat text file database. 
There are the following features to this e-commerce website: 
1-Sign up (supposed to be for the admin of the site) 
2-Sign in (also for the admin) 
3-If a user is signed in,she/he can do CRUD operations on products. 
4-None signed in visitors only see the list of products and can add items to their shopping cart. 
5-Visitors can view/edit their shopping Cart.

Note: Database is a simple text file, no DBMS is being used.
